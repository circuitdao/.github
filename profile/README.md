# Circuit Protocol

**A decentralized, asset-backed stablecoin platform built on the Chia blockchain.**

Circuit is a non-custodial Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol. It enables users to leverage XCH holdings to mint **Bytecash (BYC)**—a USD-pegged stablecoin—while retaining exposure to the underlying asset.

### Core Functionality

* **Mint & Borrow:** Deposit XCH as collateral (up to 60% LTV) to borrow Bytecash (BYC).
* **Earn Yield:** Deposit BYC into the liquidity pool to earn interest derived from borrower fees.
* **Undercollateralization Protection:** Automated liquidation mechanisms ensure protocol solvency during market volatility.
* **Non-Custodial:** Users retain full control of their funds via smart contracts (Chialisp).

### Governance

Circuit is a DAO managed on-chain via the **CRT** governance token. Token holders vote to adjust critical protocol parameters, ensuring the system remains permissionless and community-driven.

### Security & Bug Bounty

Circuit prioritizes protocol security and encourages responsible disclosure.

* **Bug Bounty:** We offer competitive rewards for critical findings via [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/code/8f671963-4313-4ac3-aed9-3186a240b75a). Scope includes Smart Contracts (Chialisp) and Core Protocol Logic.
* **Reporting:** For issues outside the bounty scope or general security inquiries, please email **security@circuitdao.com**.

### Status
* **Current Status:** Mainnet beta (TVL cap & reduced veto periods and implementation delays apply)
* **Audits:** Audited by leading security firms. See the [puzzles repo](https://github.com/circuitdao/puzzles?tab=readme-ov-file#circuit-puzzles) for more info.
