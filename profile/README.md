# Circuit Protocol

**A decentralized, asset-backed stablecoin platform built on the Chia blockchain.**

Circuit operates as a non-custodial Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol. It enables users to leverage XCH holdings to mint **Bytecash (BYC)**—a USD-pegged stablecoin—while retaining exposure to the underlying asset.

### Core Functionality

* **Mint & Borrow:** Deposit XCH as collateral (up to 66% LTV) to mint Bytecash (BYC).
* **Earn Yield:** Deposit BYC into the liquidity pool to earn interest derived from borrower fees.
* **Liquidation Protection:** Automated liquidation mechanisms ensure protocol solvency during market volatility.
* **Non-Custodial:** Users retain full control of their funds via smart contracts (Chialisp).

### Governance

Circuit is a DAO managed on-chain via the **CRT** governance token. Token holders vote to adjust critical protocol parameters, ensuring the system remains permissionless and community-driven.

### Status
* **Current State:** Beta (Testnet11)
* **Audits:** Fully audited by leading security firms.
